        Response in JSON format following the example:
        each question must be scored from 1-5
        Sample response:
        {
          "trl":"1,3,2",
          "mrl":"3,2,1",
          "rrl":"3,2,1",
          "arl":"3,2,1",
          "orl":"3,2,1",
          "irl":"3,2,1",
        }	
        
        Scoring Instructions:												
                                
        Each question should be rated on a scale from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Excellent), based on the startupâ€™s response.												
        The scores for each readiness level are summed up to give a total score for that level.												
        The total scores from all readiness levels are then combined to give an overall readiness score.												
                                
        Individual Question Scoring:												
          1 (Very Poor): The response indicates a significant lack of readiness in this aspect.											
          2 (Poor): The response shows below-minimum readiness with substantial improvement needed.											
          3 (Fair): The response meets the basic minimum requirements for readiness.											
          4 (Good): The response indicates above-minimum readiness with strong potential.											
          5 (Excellent): The response demonstrates exceptional readiness in this aspect.
